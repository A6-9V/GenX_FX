1. Understanding Jules: Foundations, Agents, Session and Task Model

1.1. Jules Architectural Overview

At its core, Jules is an asynchronous AI coding agent tightly integrated with GitHub. It clones your selected repository into a dedicated cloud VM, analyzes the full codebase, and performs tasks such as bug fixes, code documentation, and feature additions without requiring constant human guidance. Unlike autocomplete tools, Jules operates with a “plan, run, review” cycle:
- The agent generates a plan for a given prompt and repository context,
- Proceeds with stepwise code modifications,
- Provides file-level diffs for review,
- Pushes the resulting code to a new branch or pull request (PR) for you to merge.

Asynchronous operation means multiple tasks can run simultaneously, each in its own isolated VM environment, reducing bottlenecks and enabling engineering teams to run parallel changes across complex projects（e.g., large-scale trading platforms like GenX_FX）.

Key Technical Elements

- Plan Generation: AI models (Gemini 2.5 Pro) create detailed multi-step plans for each task, describing files to be modified and changes to be made.
- Self-contained VM Execution: Each session operates in its own cloud VM where dependencies can be installed, tests run, and environment-specific scripts executed.
- GitHub Integration: The agent works directly with selected repos and branches. Changes are presented as diffs and PRs, maintaining full auditability.
- Multi-Agent Documentation Awareness: By reading the project’s AGENTS.md (if available), Jules adapts to custom workflows, tools, and external integration models.

1.2. The Jules Task and Session Model

1.2.1. Session Structure

A session in Jules represents a continuous, contextual unit of work on a specific repository and branch. Every session is initiated with a user-defined prompt describing what to accomplish (e.g., “Refactor the gold signal generator and update documentation”), alongside repository and branch metadata.

Metadata tracked per session:
- Session ID (globally unique)
- Repository reference and branch
- Prompt (task instruction)
- Activity log (chronological trace of agent and user actions)
- Plan and approval state (whether the task plan is approved)
- Result status (in progress, completed, paused, error, etc.)
- Attachments (optional images for context)

1.2.2. Task Structure

A task designates a specific action or objective given to the Jules agent—mapped one-to-one with sessions. Tasks may be created via web UI, CLI, API, or directly from GitHub issues (with a “jules” label).

Task Life Cycle:
1. Creation: Define repo, branch, and prompt; optionally attach images or setup scripts.
2. Planning: Jules proposes a stepwise execution plan for review.
3. Approval/Replanning: User can approve, edit plan, or request further clarification; Jules can replan as needed.
4. Execution: VM environment is provisioned; work is performed (code changes, test runs, doc updates).
5. Summary and Diff: On completion, a diff and summary are provided; user can commit branch and open PR.
6. Post-Task Actions: Additional feedback and revisions can be made, or further tasks initiated.

1.2.3. Session-Task Relationship Mapping

Each session in Jules manages the entirety of one resolved task, allowing for stateful, multi-turn conversation and iterative progress tracking. Activities within a session log all communication and actions (agent plans, user approvals, code commits, comments)—enabling fine-grained review and compliance with audit requirements, critical in regulated industries like brokerage and fintech.

2. Jules Tools CLI, Web UI, and API: Exploring Session and Task Operations

2.1. Jules Tools CLI and Remote Session Commands

The Jules Tools Command Line Interface (CLI) is a lightweight, scriptable dashboard for managing coding agent sessions directly from the local terminal or remote environments.

CLI Feature Summary:

- jules login – Authenticate with Google and authorize your session.
- jules remote list --repo – List connected repos.
- jules remote list --session – List all active and historical sessions.
- jules remote new --repo <repo> --session "<prompt>" – Create a new remote session (and corresponding task).
- jules remote pull --session <id> – Retrieve results and artifacts from a completed session.
- jules version, jules completion <shell> – CLI version and shell completion scripts.
- No-arg invocation (jules) – Launches interactive TUI dashboard for real-time visual tracking.

Deep Integration Capabilities

- Sessions and tasks can be launched programmatically (e.g., from a shell script, CI pipeline, or as part of a bulk workflow).
- Compose Jules CLI with other dev tools (e.g., gh issue list | jules remote new ...), supporting automated session creation from issues, TODO lists, or other sources.
- State and task logs can be pulled down and incorporated into external documentation or compliance records.

Scripting Example:
`bash
cat TODO.md | while read line; do jules remote new --repo . --session "$line"; done
`
This one-liner creates one Jules session per TODO item, automating mundane documentation or testing tasks across a codebase.

---

2.2. Web UI Workflow and Task Review

The web interface complements the CLI by offering:
- Repo selection and branch targeting
- Prompt input and attachment browser
- Session dashboard: view all tasks, their status, and progress
- Plan review and approval
- Inline diff viewing and branch creation
- Pause, resume, or delete task functionality
- Notifications for completion or feedback needed

Notably, each running Jules task presents a live activity feed, showing real-time stepwise progress, agent and user dialogue, and a visual summary of code edits—a model especially suitable for audit-driven or collaborative settings.

---

2.3. API and Automation Extensions

The Jules API (currently in alpha) allows for direct integration with third-party tools, scripting, and advanced DevOps automation. Core objects include:
- Source: The codebase or input (e.g., a GitHub repo)
- Session: The work context containing one or more activities
- Activity: Discrete events (plan, user message, code update) within a session
- Programmatic plan approval and result polling: Approve plans, send messages, retrieve activity logs, trigger new sessions in code

API usage examples include:
- Triggering code/documentation tasks from CI pipelines or other bots
- Aggregating documentation improvements or bug fixes across microservices from a config file or centralized dashboard
- Integrating with Slack, Linear, or other workflow managers for multi-agent orchestration.

3. AGENTS.md and Plan Generation: Jules Awareness, Documentation, and Context Sensitivity

3.1. AGENTS.md in Repository Context

A significant recent update is Jules’ support for context-aware automation via AGENTS.md. This markdown file, if present in a repo’s root, lists agent specifications, workflows, and conventions, serving both humans and AI agents.

- Purpose: Instruct agents (like Jules) about available code tools, process flows, input/output schemas, API endpoints, and context-specific behaviors.
- Benefit: Reduces generic or incorrect plans by giving precise guidance for automation within complex, multi-agent or multi-service codebases, such as GenX_FX.

Typical AGENTS.md Content:
- Definitions of custom trading bots or agents (roles, tasks handled)
- Integration patterns (“Use ampcli.py for authentication; signals are published to signaloutput/...”)
- Expected input/output contracts (e.g., JSON strategies, CSV signals)
- Example commands or Docker invocation patterns

3.2. Impact on Plan Generation and Task Quality

Jules reads AGENTS.md at the start of plan formation. The agent parses the roles, strategies, and critical automation concepts described, then tailors its plan and code generation accordingly. This prevents “one size fits all” code, increases plan reliability, and supports deeper automation in N-tier architectures.

Use Cases in GenX_FX:
- Automatic detection of custom expert advisor directories, signal generation conventions, and bash scripts.
- Proper integration of trading signal validation, configuration reloading, or deployment-specific behaviors.
- Enhanced generation of in-repo documentation, ensuring that organizational and agent policies are explicitly followed, avoiding accidental overwrites of mission-critical automation flows.

4.2. System Architectural Insights

The GenX_FX platform is built on modular, cloud-native architecture:
- Event-Driven & Microservice Patterns: Real-time signals, data ingestion, and trading events are managed asynchronously; modules communicate via messages or intermediary stores (see event-driven system design patterns).
- Separation of Interfaces: The system delineates CLI orchestration, strategy validation, core engine logic, and broker/API endpoints for clean encapsulation and extensibility.
- Multi-Agent Awareness: The presence of AGENT.md, amp_system, and plugin directories highlight readiness for both human- and agent-driven automation. Jules is natively compatible with this paradigm.
- Comprehensive Test and Deployment Automation: The project supports extensive test automation (run_tests.py), integration test reports, and programmatic deployment via Docker, AWS shell scripts, and cloudbuild workflows.

Trading Automation Workflows

- Signal Generation→API Output→Expert Advisor Execution: AI models produce signals fed to EAs and trading endpoints.
- Automated Testing/Backtesting→Deployment: Strategies and EAs are tested and validated before release.
- Continuous Documentation, Compliance, and Review: Documentation and configuration management are integral, with markdown guides and setup checklists.

- Test automation is enforced (Jules plans can include “run all signal validation tests before commit”),
- Error-prone manual steps are replaced with repeatable, agent-driven execution.

---

5.3. Practical Applications and Workflow Patterns

Automatable Flows (with Jules sessions/tasks):

| Scenario                                   | Jules Task Example                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Update signal validation and doc            | “Refactor signalvalidators/, update documentation in PROJECTSUMMARY.md”    |
| Sync EA setup guide with code changes       | “Revise EASETUPGUIDE.md to include latest changes to GenXGoldMaster_EA”  |
| Add tests and backtest reporting            | “Implement new unit tests in tests/, generate a weekly backtest report”      |
| Migrate configuration formats               | “Update .env.example and config/ for new deployment procedures”              |
| Generate cross-module architecture doc      | “Generate SYSTEMARCHITECTUREGUIDE.md based on refactored amp_system/”      |
| Prepare release and compliance checklist    | “Create FINALDEPLOYMENTCHECKLIST.md from all current deployment scripts”   |

These tasks, managed as Jules sessions, are logged, diffed, and (if approved) result in branches and PRs ready for review in the GenX_FX repo.

---

5.4. Limitations and Considerations

- Task Complexity and Prompt Quality: Jules performs best with clear, single-purpose prompts. Overly vague or multifaceted instructions may require iterative guidance.
- Customization in MQL4/5: While Jules is code-agnostic, very domain-specific MQL refactors might require manual review for platform nuances.
- Plan Approval Loop: Strategic architectural changes may need detailed human review and approval, especially in regulated trading environments.
- Integration Testing in Cloud VM: Some trading integrations (broker APIs, live testnets) might not be fully accessible in the agent’s sandboxed VM, requiring mock/test data for full coverage.
